# Task-16-Incident-Response-Security-Breach-Simulation

# Overview

This project simulates a basic SSH brute-force style incident
on a Kali Linux system. The objective is to practice log analysis,
incident classification, containment, eradication, recovery, and
documentation.

----
# Scenario

Repeated failed SSH login attempts targeting an invalid user
account were generated intentionally.

-----
# Key Activities

- Log analysis using journalctl
- Identification of suspicious authentication failures
- Incident classification (Brute-force attempt) 
- Containment via firewall and account lock 
- Deployment of Fail2Ban
- System recovery and validation
----

# Outcome

The simulation successfully demonstrated the incident response

---
lifecycle and defensive controls.
